    As much as I would like to do the typical "I am a robot, and this is my ai generated summary with 3000 action verbs", I'm not going to do that. My name is Link Lee, you can call me Link or Jack, doesn't really matter. I'm a Software Engineer / Front-End Developer with a very... we'll just call it challenging and interesting background. I grew up in Las Vegas where a pretty big chunk of my professional career happened before pursuing my actual dream in Software Development! I even played Video Games professionally for a while, go figure. After a few caffeine and adderall driven years of screaming "**** ***" to a monitor while debugging and coding like a monkey, here we are. I just want to keep learning and growing and I can't wait for the next few decades of it. 🚀
